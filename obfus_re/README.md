# Obfus Re

Binary with XOR obfuscated key value

To replace the flag value, XOR the random string with the new flag value and place the resulting hex in the file.

### Solution

Either reverse engineer the program and realize that there are two strings that are XORed and XOR them together to find the key. 

OR 

Bruteforce the input
